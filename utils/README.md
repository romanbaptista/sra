# `utils`

This directory contains shared utility scripts used by the sra-download pipeline.

The scripts in `utils/` provide reusable, defensive helper logic that supports:
- Preflight validation
- Tool installation and verification
- Configuration enforcement
- Deterministic pipeline behavior under strict Bash execution

Utility scripts are sourced by:
- `run_pipeline.sh`
- Preflight scripts
- Pipeline module scripts (where required)

They are not intended to be executed directly.

# Design Contract
All utility scripts in this directory adhere to the following principles:
- Pure helper logic only (no pipeline orchestration)
- Safe operation under `set -euo pipefail`
- Explicit, readable control flow
- Clear and actionable error messages
- No reliance on implicit working directories
- No modification of global system settings
- Deterministic behavior across HPC environments

Utility functions are stateless and rely entirely on:
- Explicit function arguments, and/or
- Variables provided by sourced pipeline context

# Utility Script Overview
```text
arrays.sh
functions_base.sh
functions_edirect.sh
functions_sratoolkit.sh
```

Each script serves a narrow, well‑defined purpose and participates in a clear separation of concerns between validation, installation, and execution.

## `arrays.sh`
Defines the canonical arrays that describe the structure and requirements of the sra-download pipeline.

### Responsibilities
- Declares the set of module scripts that comprise the pipeline
- Declares the set of framework‑level external commands required
- Declares the set of required user configuration variables

All preflight scripts defer to `arrays.sh` as the single source of truth for what must be validated.

### Arrays

| Array | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|
| `SCRIPT_ARRAY` | Ordered list of pipeline module scripts |
| `COMMAND_ARRAY` | Framework‑level commands required by the pipeline |
| `VARIABLE_ARRAY` | Required user‑defined configuration variables |

This script contains no logic and is purely declarative.

## `functions_base.sh`

Provides core validation and helper functions used throughout the pipeline.

### Responsibilities
- Validates files, directories, commands, and variables
- Enforces non‑empty configuration values
- Provides consistent error handling and messaging
- Supplies reusable filesystem and path helpers
- Writes reproducible environment files for tool configuration

These functions form the foundation upon which all preflight validation is built.

### Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|
| `check_file` | Confirms that a regular file exists |
| `check_file_data` | Confirms that a file exists and is non‑empty |
| `check_directory` | Confirms that a directory exists |
| `check_variable` | Confirms that a named variable is set and non‑empty |
| `check_command` | Confirms that a command is available in PATH |
| `check_executable` | Confirms that a file exists and is executable |
| `make_executable` | Adds execute permissions to a file |
| `check_arg` | Confirms that required function arguments are provided |
| `fail` | Emits an error message and terminates execution |
| `write_env` | Writes a reproducible environment file for tool setup |
| `get_directory` | Resolves the directory containing a given path |
| `get_parent_directory` | Resolves the parent directory of a given path |

All functions are designed to fail early and emit context‑rich error messages.

## `functions_edirect.sh`
Provides EDirect‑specific helpers for validation and installation.

### Responsibilities
- Detects whether NCBI EDirect is installed and usable
- Downloads and installs EDirect if missing
- Derives and exports the EDirect installation directory
- Supports deterministic setup during preflight

All EDirect logic is centralized here so that pipeline modules do not need to handle tool availability or installation.

### Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|
| `check_edirect` | Verifies EDirect availability and derives EDIRECT_DIR |
| `download_edirect` | Downloads and installs EDirect via the official installer |
| `install_edirect` | Runs installation and enforces post‑install validation |

EDirect installation occurs only during preflight, never during pipeline execution.

## `functions_sratoolkit.sh`
Provides SRA Toolkit‑specific helpers for validation and installation.

### Responsibilities
- Detects whether a coherent SRA Toolkit installation is available
- Enforces a pinned SRA Toolkit version
- Downloads and installs the toolkit if missing or incorrect
- Derives and exports the toolkit installation directory
- Supports per‑accession VDB configuration downstream

This script centralizes all SRA Toolkit invariants so that module scripts may assume correctness at runtime.

### Functions
| Function | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|
| `check_sratoolkit` | Verifies toolkit presence, version, and directory coherence |
| `download_sratoolkit` | Downloads a pinned SRA Toolkit archive |
| `extract_sratoolkit` | Extracts the toolkit and exposes binaries to `PATH` |
| `install_sratoolkit` | Orchestrates installation and post‑install validation |

As with EDirect, SRA Toolkit installation is repeat‑safe and confined to preflight.

# Usage
Utility scripts are sourced where required and must not be executed directly.

`functions_base.sh` is sourced by:
- `run_pipeline.sh`
- All preflight scripts
- Any module script requiring helper functions

Tool‑specific utility scripts are sourced only by:
- Their corresponding preflight scripts

# Error Handling
All utility functions are designed to:
- Fail immediately on invalid input
- Emit concise, context‑aware error messages
- Prevent execution from progressing in an unsafe state

This ensures that pipeline failures occur as early and close to the source of the problem as possible.

# Notes
- Utility functions deliberately contain no pipeline execution logic
- Tool installation logic is isolated, deterministic, and repeat‑safe
- No utility script assumes a specific SLURM or tmux execution context
- Adding a new tool or pipeline stage should include corresponding utility helpers
- All validation logic is centralized; modules do not repeat checks
